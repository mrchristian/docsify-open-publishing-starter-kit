High-quality trainings are fundamental when aiming at a cultural change towards the implementation of Open Science principles. Teaching resources provide great support for Open Science instructors and trainers. The Open Science training handbook will be a key resource and a first step towards developing Open Access and Open Science curricula and andragogies. Supporting and connecting an emerging Open Science community that wishes to pass on their knowledge as multipliers, the handbook will enrich training activities and unlock the community’s full potential.</p><p>Sharing their experience and skills of imparting Open Science principles, the authors (see <a href="https://book.fosteropenscience.eu/en/#the-authors-and-the-book-sprint-facilitators">below</a>) produced an open knowledge and educational resource oriented to practical teaching. The focus of the new handbook is not spreading the ideas of Open Science, but showing <strong>how</strong> to spread these ideas most effectively. The form of a book sprint as a collaborative writing process maximized creativity and innovation, and ensured the production of a valuable resource in just a few days.</p><p>Bringing together methods, techniques, and practices, the handbook aims at supporting educators of Open Science. The result is intended as a helpful guide on how to forward knowledge on Open Science principles to our networks, institutions, colleagues, and students. It will instruct and inspire trainers how to create high quality and engaging trainings. Addressing challenges and giving solutions, it will strengthen the community of Open Science trainers who are educating, informing, and inspiring themselves.</p><h1 id="H3046972">Help us making the handbook better</h1><p>We welcome comments and feedback from everyone, irrespective of their expertise or background.
